1 - Network Usage
Networks are used for a number of reasons, one way or another itâ€™s usually about sharing:

Information: we use networks for applications like e-mail or to reach certain websites.
File sharing: we need a network so that users can reach a shared network drive with documents, pictures and/or other files.
Resource sharing: we can connect a printer to the network that is used by multiple users. No need to connect a printer directly to each computer.
Application sharing: we might have users that require access to the same application. For example, a finance department with five users that need access to the same bookkeeping software.
A network can be as small as two computers that are directly connected to each other or as large as the Internet with millions of devices.
